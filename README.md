# Binary Tree DSA Questions Repository

Welcome to the Binary Tree DSA Questions Repository! This repository is structured to provide a range of questions related to Binary Trees in Java, categorized by different difficulty levels.

## Overview:

This repository includes questions categorized into different levels, each focusing on specific aspects of Binary Tree concepts. The naming convention for the questions is as follows:

- **LEVEL 1:** Fundamental concepts and basic tree structures sourced from GeekForGeeks, past POP Lab assignments, or custom-made questions.
- **LEVEL 2:** Intermediate level questions sourced from GeekForGeeks, past POP Lab assignments, or custom-made questions.
- **LEVEL 3:** Advanced level questions sourced from GeekForGeeks, past POP Lab assignments, or custom-made questions.
- **LEVEL UNDETERMINED - POP LAB:** Challenging questions sourced from the POP Lab, covering various operations on binary trees.
- **LEVEL UNDETERMINED - CUSTOM MADE:** Unique challenges created by the author to test and enhance your understanding of Binary Trees.
